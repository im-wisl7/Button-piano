# 🎹 Arduino Mini Piano

A 5-button mini piano built using Arduino and a passive buzzer.
This project allows the user to play classical-style melodies inspired by Beethoven using physical buttons.


## 📌 Project Description

This is a simple embedded systems project using an Arduino board.
Each push button represents a musical note. When pressed, the buzzer plays a specific frequency.

The system uses:
- Digital input reading
- INPUT_PULLUP logic
- tone() function for sound generation
- Conditional control structure

The piano is tuned to play notes inspired by "Für Elise" by Beethoven.


## 🛠 Hardware Components

- Arduino Uno
- 5 Push Buttons
- 1 Passive Buzzer
- 5 LEDs (optional)
- 220Ω resistors (for LEDs)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
